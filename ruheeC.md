## About Me

Howdy my name is Ruhee Charolia and I'm from College Station, Texas. I'm a Technology Management major and I plan to graduate in December 2022. 
I have a passion for cooking and trying new food. In my free time I watch my favorite shows. I love to travel with my family to different places over the world.
