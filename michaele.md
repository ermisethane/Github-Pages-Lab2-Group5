# Howdy! My name is Michael Elege. I am a senior Technology Management student! 
I plan on becoming a Scrum Master or a Technical Project Manager after I graduate. 

## My interests: 
-rock climbing <br>
-white water rafting<br>
-traveling to new places<br>
-I also just got into skateboarding and long boarding one week ago

I actually invest into real estate on the side. I currently have two houses that I rent out short term on AirBnB! 
One of them are here in BCS so if you know anyone coming into town needing a place to stay, you should check it out!
